**NO SIGNIFICANT IMBALANCE DETECTED**

**arr**

Array CGH analysis of DNA from XXX has been carried out using oligonucleotide arrays with ~60,000 probes across the genome.

This test identified a deletion of approximately XXXMb from band/s XXX to YYY in the short/long arm of chromosome A, between base pair coordinates XXXX and YYYY.
OR
This test identified a duplication of approximately XXXMb of material originating from the short/long arm of chromosome A; the duplicated region is from band/s XXX to YYY, between base pair coordinates XXXX and YYYY.

The deleted/duplicated region contains no genes known to have clinical relevance for XXX’s referral indication of XXX.

**This finding is considered likely to represent benign copy number variation.**

No other imbalance was detected (excluding established population polymorphisms). The results are consistent with a female/male chromosome complement.

If considered appropriate for reassurance, blood samples in EDTA from XXX’s parents would be accepted for inheritance studies.
